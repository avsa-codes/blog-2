      I looked at the familiar cracks on the ceiling as I leaned my head back on the chair. I was in
my room after so long. I had missed this, the silence, the privacy that I barely get when I am
in my PG. Why did I have to get the most boring roommates? But at least they are not
annoying. I barely even talk to them. The longest conversation I had with them was when
one of them asked me when I was going back to my home, and that’s it.
I was planning to go home by bus. First, I take a direct electric bus to Davangere from
Bangalore, and from there I can go to Ranebennur.
Seems pretty simple, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, my first mistake was that I went to the wrong terminal of the bus stand (yeah,
apparently bus stands also have terminals).
    </p>
    <p>And my second mistake was to ask an auto driver for help. Now, I always thought they were
just annoying to non-Kannada speakers, but no, they just happen to hate everyone. He took
me to this little shop where a guy books tickets for people. Long story short, I got a bypass
sleeper bus instead of an electric bus. No, I didn’t get scammed, at least not that day. As
soon as Ranebennur arrived, the bus left me at the bypass, and I just stood there with my
extremely heavy backpack and a jacket around my waist. For a second, I didn’t know what to
do at all. Then I opened my phone and called my brother to pick me up from this lonely place
in between highways.</p>
<p>While waiting for him, I looked around, and I didn’t see a lot of women around me. Most of
them were men, and a lot of them stared at me. Maybe because it’s not common for a girl to
be standing here, and more uncommon to be wearing a Las Vegas sweatshirt and jeans. All
the women I noticed here were in their sarees, with those red-coloured bangles on each of
their wrists. I wondered how they functioned with that many bangles on an everyday basis.
Finally, my brother was here, and I instantly smiled. We talked on our way home. I looked up
at the trees that I was so used to seeing. I let the shadows from the trees fall on me, and I
smiled. I was back in my tiny little town again, and it had been six months. As much as I
dreaded living here and wanted to move out every second while I was here, I was happy to
be back. As I got home, I took a long hot shower and had the best lunch ever and an even
better nap after that. I call myself a serial napper. I enjoy napping a lot. There’s nothing in
this world that could relax me more than an afternoon nap after my lunch.
I was not in that fast-paced world anymore. Time slowed down here. I cannot emphasize
how relaxed I felt. I didn’t have to worry about washing dishes or doing laundry or making
sure I ate on time. The food was placed right in front of me. I will miss this when I go back.
After a few days, I went to camp with my cousin and her family. We stayed in this little tiny
blue house in a jungle, almost. There was a bonfire, really good food, and laughter. I felt so
happy. We had taken our dog with us; his name is Teddy.</p>
<p>When I was back home, I noticed that some people looked at me differently. They looked at
me as someone more responsible, more mature, more grown up. It’s completely bizarre to
me because I’ve always been that irresponsible, rebellious teenager who hated everything
and everyone.</p>
<p>This time, though, I was seen differently. As someone who understood life, who could handle
things now. That still feels strange to write. I guess it just keeps getting weirder. Someday,

they might even see me as an adult who can make her own decisions. Although that day still
feels a bit far away.</p>
